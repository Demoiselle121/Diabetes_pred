# Overview
According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 1 in 7 adults currently suffers from diabetes. By 2050, this number could skyrocket to 1 in 3 adults.

To address this growing concern, this project leverages Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on input data.

The project is divided into two main parts:

Machine Learning Model Evaluation
Deep Learning Model Evaluation
